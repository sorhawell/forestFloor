##### 1.9.0

New Features:
 * user no longer have to use the trimTrees:cinbag to train a classification forest to obtain inbag counts as randomForest some time ago started to support inbag counts. Restrictions and error messages removed.
 * any graphical argument can passed through plot.forestFloor to plot or points. GOF_col arg is changed to GOF_args. If conflicts with internal arguments, user provided arguments have priority.
 * likewise for vec.plot, plot and plot3d through ..., points and surface3d through moreArgs=list()
 * graphical parameters par() can be set temporarily through dot args plot.forestFloor(,...). Hereby, e.g. mar or mfrow can be set manually and will override standard settings of this function.
 
Misc:
 * Major revision of all docs & examples
 

##### 1.8.9

New features:
* XY axes can be cropped for outliers also in show3d
* forestFloor supports class randomForest.formula and will try other subclasses of randomForest
* fcol(byResiduals) fcol support color gradients perpendicular to fitted functions
* ggplot functions has been completely disabled
* link to webpage forestFloor.dk

Bugs:
 * Z-label in show3d was sometimes written twice
 * If forestFloor X input is matrix without dimnames, show3d() plot labels were messed up.

##### 1.8.7-1.8.8:

 * forestFloor will support rfPermute models (easy, as they are 95% a randomForest object)
 * fix bug, show3d will produce error of only on feature contribution column is selected
 * fix bug, test input in randomForest functions will prpevent forestFloor from runnig including a   * test input in randomForest (xtest , ytest) make keep.forest default FALSE If forest is missing, error meassage prompts user to force keep.forest=T.
set Xi=1:2 as default, in show3d.forestFloor_multiClass
